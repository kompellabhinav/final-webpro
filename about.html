        <!-- Section 2 - Project Description -->
        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>I chose to create the Workout Tracker website because I noticed a common challenge among fitness enthusiasts - keeping track of their workout progress. Many people struggle to remember their exercises, sets, and weights from previous workouts. I wanted to solve this problem by developing an easy-to-use platform where users can log and review their workouts conveniently.</p>
            <p>My goal is to inspire individuals to stay committed to their fitness routines and celebrate their achievements along the way. I believe that consistent tracking of workouts leads to better performance and long-term fitness success.</p>

        <!-- Section 3 - Technology Description -->
        <section class="technology-section">
            <h2>Technology Used</h2>
            <p>For the Workout Tracker website, I utilized a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. The front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a responsive and visually appealing user interface. We also incorporated the Bootstrap framework for a consistent layout and responsive design across different devices.</p>
            <p>On the back-end, we used node.js to handle user authentication, data storage, and interaction with the database. To store and manage workout data, we employed MongoDB as the database management system. I also used EJS to update the html automatically depending on size of data.</p>

            <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
            <p>Throughout this class, I have gained valuable knowledge and skills in web development using various technologies. I learned the importance of planning and designing user-friendly interfaces for better user experiences. Additionally, I honed our proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, allowing us to create dynamic and interactive web applications.</p>
            <p>Moreover, working on the Workout Tracker project has taught us the significance of problem-solving. I am grateful for the opportunity to apply our learning to a real-world project and contribute to the fitness community.</p>
